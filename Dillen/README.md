# DILLEN (Escape from underground)

My try for develop some simple game for zx-spectrum. Before many times ago we are develops some demos for zx-spectrum with my friends and this is my nostalgic little moment. In project you can find image where is showed my draw of the rooms of this simple game. It's old paper based drawing, I thing that I was maybe 15-16-17 years old when I draw it. Well it's realy nostalgic and beautiful times for me.
